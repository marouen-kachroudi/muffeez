## üîë Key Takeaways

1. **Layer 4 Load Balancing**  
   Operates at the **transport layer (OSI Layer 4)**, distributing incoming traffic based on **IP address** and **port**.  

2. **Public vs. Internal Load Balancers**  
   - **Public Load Balancer:** Directs internet traffic to your Azure VMs.  
   - **Internal Load Balancer:** Manages traffic within a **virtual network** or from **on-premises networks**.  

3. **High Availability & Scalability**  
   Supports **millions of concurrent flows**, ensuring applications remain responsive under heavy loads.  

4. **Health Probes**  
   Continuously monitor the health of backend resources, **rerouting traffic away from unhealthy instances**.  

5. **Outbound Connectivity**  
   Provides **outbound internet access** for VMs without public IP addresses.  

6. **Security by Default**  
   Built on the **Zero Trust security model**, ensuring only **authorized traffic** reaches your resources.  

7. **Multiple SKUs**  
   Choose between **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Gateway SKUs** based on scale and requirements.  

8. **Integration with Azure Monitor**  
   Gain insights into **performance** and **health metrics**, enabling proactive management.

## üåê Why It Matters

Whether you‚Äôre architecting **multi-tier applications** or managing **hybrid connectivity**, knowing how to distribute load effectively can dramatically influence **scalability** and **availability**.  

Azure Load Balancer brings the fundamentals of **cloud-native design** into practice:  
- **High availability**  
- **Fault tolerance**  
- **Seamless failover**  

All embedded in a service you can **automate, monitor, and integrate** into larger architectures.
