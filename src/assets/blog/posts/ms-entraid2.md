# What lies at the core of secure access in Microsoft‚Äôs cloud environment?

Let‚Äôs explore the foundation behind this secure ecosystem‚Ä¶ **Microsoft Entra ID**.

Once again, this post highlights **Microsoft Entra ID**, Microsoft‚Äôs cloud-native solution for managing identities and securing access. Built to empower organisations, it simplifies the administration of users, devices, and permissions across applications and data. Formerly known as **Azure Active Directory**, Entra ID serves as the core engine for authentication and authorisation throughout Microsoft‚Äôs cloud ecosystem. Whether for employees, partners, or guests, Entra ID ensures modern, scalable, and centralised access control at every level.

## Best Practices

Handling Microsoft Entra ID goes far beyond simply creating accounts or configuring sign-ins; it‚Äôs about building a robust, scalable identity framework that secures access while maintaining seamless user productivity.

---

### üõë 1. Secure Admin Access
- Enforce **MFA** for all admins ‚Äî *no exceptions*.
- Restrict access to the portal using **Conditional Access** policies (e.g., location, device compliance).
- Utilize **break-glass accounts** (emergency accounts) and closely monitor them.

---

### üîê 2. Master Conditional Access
- Think of Conditional Access as your *if-this-then-that* security engine.
- Enforce policies such as:
  - **MFA required** if signing in from outside the corporate network.
  - Block **legacy authentication protocols**.
  - Require a **compliant device** for sensitive apps.
- Test policies in **report-only mode** before enforcing them to avoid lockouts.

---

### üßΩ 3. Clean Up Legacy & Unused Identities
- Regularly review:
  - Inactive accounts (*e.g., no login for 90 days*).
  - **Unlicensed users** ‚Äî they may not need an account.
  - **Guest accounts** ‚Äî disable or delete if no longer needed.
- Enable **lifecycle policies** for auto-cleanup of stale identities.

---

### üìö 4. Train and Document Everything
- Maintain internal **playbooks** and **standard operating procedures (SOPs)** for identity operations.
- Document your **Conditional Access rules**, **RBAC mappings**, and **custom roles**.
- Train admins and helpdesk teams on **safe identity practices**.
