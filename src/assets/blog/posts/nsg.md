# Securing Azure Resources with Network Security Groups (NSGs)

How can you secure Azure resources from unwanted traffic while ensuring smooth operations?  
The answer lies in **Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs).**

Azure Network Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound network traffic to Azure resources. They are essential for securing your virtual networks by defining rules that allow or deny traffic based on factors like IP address, port, and protocol.

## Key Components of NSGs

- **Security Rules:** Define the conditions under which traffic is allowed or denied. Each rule includes:
  - **Name:** A unique identifier for the rule.  
  - **Priority:** A number between 100 and 4096 that determines the order in which rules are applied (*lower numbers = higher priority*).  
  - **Source/Destination:** Specifies the origin and destination of the traffic.  
  - **Port Range:** Defines the ports to which the rule applies.  
  - **Protocol:** Indicates the protocol (*TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.*).  
  - **Direction:** Specifies whether the rule applies to inbound or outbound traffic.  
  - **Action:** Determines whether the traffic is allowed or denied.  

- **Default Rules:** Pre-configured rules that cannot be deleted but can be overridden by custom rules with higher priority.  

- **Augmented Security Rules:** Allow specifying multiple IP addresses and ranges in a single rule, simplifying rule management.

## Associating NSGs with Azure Resources

- **Subnets:** Applying an NSG to a subnet affects all resources within that subnet.  
- **Network Interfaces (NICs):** Associating an NSG with a NIC applies the rules to the specific resource.  
- **Multiple Associations:** A resource can have multiple NSGs associated (one at the subnet level and one at the NIC level), and the rules from both are evaluated.

## How NSGs Evaluate Traffic

NSGs evaluate traffic based on a **five-tuple**:  
*source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol.*  

When traffic matches a rule, processing stops, and the action (*allow or deny*) is applied.  
If no match is found, the **default rules** are applied.

## Best Practices for Using NSGs

- **Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege by only allowing necessary traffic.  
- **Use Service Tags:** Leverage Azure service tags to simplify rule management and automatically update IP address ranges.  
- **Monitor and Log:** Enable NSG flow logs to monitor and analyze traffic patterns.  
- **Review Regularly:** Periodically review and update NSG rules to ensure they align with current security requirements.

## Conclusion

**Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)** are a fundamental component of Azure's security framework, providing **granular control** over network traffic. By understanding and implementing NSGs effectively, you can **enhance the security posture** of your Azure resources and ensure compliance with organizational policies.
